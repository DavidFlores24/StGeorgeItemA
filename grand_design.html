            <h3>1.168...or ⏀ (Phi)</h3>
            <p>The ancient Greeks certainly knew a thing or two about how to build, and some say it was more than a mere eye for design that led them to create such impressive, and visually satisfying, wonders as the Parthenon. Many believe there is a mathematical principle behind such structures, used to create visual perfection and uniformity of shape and symmetry; and not just in man-made wonders, the figure (1.168) can be found in nature too. <br/>
              <br/>
              It was a Greek architect named Phidias (after whom the figure ‘Phi’ is named) who is largely held responsible for the idea of this ‘Golden Ratio’ - also known as the ‘Divine Proportion’, ‘Golden Section’, or ‘Golden Rectangle’. He designed the Parthenon, that great temple that so inspired Robert Smirke in the early 1800s, and it is believed by subscribers-to-the-theory that the various parts of its facade can be neatly broken down into golden rectangles; so too the ground plan of the building… </p>

            <h3>Golden Rectangle</h3>
            <p>A ‘golden’ rectangle is created by multiplying the length of the shorter side by 1.168 in order to get the perfect length of the longer side. <br/>
              <br/>
              Beyond that it was believed by the Greeks that the dimensions of a space could be designed in such as way as to yield the best sounds; a theory they employed in their amphitheatres, and roofed theatres. Others say it is actually more luck than real judgment, or understanding, and in the case of St George’s it is likely to be a bit of both. Certainly in the physical scale of the structure, there are parts that fit the formula, but others that do not. <br/>
              <br/>
              'Rectangular shapes are the component materials of every modern work.’ Robert Smirke <br/>
              <br/>
              Robert Smirke, once described as an ‘architect of the rectangular’, understood what the use of the main space would be, and that the dimensions of the room - not to mention the addition of a flat ceiling - would aid the congregation in hearing the Minister’s words, in an age long before microphones. That music would fill the space so beautifully too could not have been a consideration in 1821… </p>

            <h3>The rise of Neo-Classical Architecture</h3>
            <p>Reason and rationality, just two words that describe the new wave that swept through British architecture in the 19th century. Improved access to the Eastern Mediterranean meant that scholars, artists and diplomats were ‘discovering’ for themselves the great structures and design principles of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The great temples were measured, sketched and borrowed from - quite literally, with bits being brought back to England for display. <br/>
              <br/>
              Classical motifs were, until this time, being used as just that, decoration. A column might be painted onto a facade or interior as ornamentation, but not actually serve a physical purpose. The likes of Robert Smirke, who in his early twenties was acquainting himself with Greek and Roman modes of design, saw the benefits of reintroducing these ancient design principles into modern day buildings, and played his part in what was an architectural revolution. <br/>
              <br/>
              There was, then, a purging, or purifying, of architectural design in this country. Smirke himself felt that designing buildings in this way resulted in nobler, simpler, grander, and more magnificent structures. He, like his mentors and colleagues John Soane, and John Nash, used columns to bear weight, rather than merely painting them on because they looked nice. <br/>
              <br/>
              It is this, and the use of geometric forms such as rectangles, triangles and circles, together, that gave their buildings such weight and visual impact. British buildings began to exude intellect, order, and strength; which is just how the country itself wanted to be perceived. </p>

            <h3>The Neo-Classical features of St George</h3>
            <p>Robert Smirke’s design for St George’s is based on the basic box shape he employed in other churches for the Commissioners, namely St James (Hackney, now demolished), St Mary’s (Marylebone), St Philips (Salford), St Anne’s (Wandsworth) and St John’s (Chatham). These boxes allowed for maximum capacity within, and the dimensions and flat ceiling aided the acoustic. Where Smirke differentiated his design was in the more elaborate additions to either the East or West ends of the the churches, in the form of porticos (or porches) and towers. <br/>
              <br/>
              For St George’s Smirke placed his portico at the South East end which, at the time, would have been visible from the harbour and riverside below. It made a grand statement for sure, though covers what is in fact the back of the church. <br/>
              <br/>
              The portico is designed in ‘tetrastyle’, in that it has four columns. The columns here are of the ‘Doric order’, one of three orders of ancient column designs used by the Greeks, and then the Romans. The other two orders are ‘Ionic’ and ‘Corinthian’. Doric columns feature a simple round ‘capital’ at the top (this is the stone that sits between the column and the load above). While it is considered a stronger and more masculine design, it’s also a bit cheaper… <br/>
              <br/>
              Above the columns is a plain ‘Architrave’ or framing block and then the ‘Frieze’. Our frieze features grooved blocks (‘triglyph’), and pieces that look a lot like Lego bricks (‘guttae’). These ornaments hark back to the even more ancient wooden temples, and represent what would have been the ends of beams, and the pegs that held them together. The top of the portico, a triangle, is edged with a simple ornamental ‘cornice’. <br/>
              <br/>
              This and all the pieces below it are directly borrowed from the Temple of Theseus (amongst others), a building Smirke observed and drew in detail. The design appears in other Smirke buildings, such as his Theatre at Covent Garden (lost to fire) and a mausoleum in Nottinghamshire. It’s a common design, though, and other architects used it in their own works; so it’s possible it was copied from a pattern book, which was a trend. The 45 steps that lead to the portico only add to the ‘temple’ look, though these were built out of necessity, as the building sits on a slope. <br/>
              <br/>
              Crowning the portico is a short lantern shaped tower (where the bells would have hung) sitting on a square plinth. On top of that is a ‘cupola’, or rounded dome. Smirke’s churches in Wandsworth, Marylebone and Salford each have similar cupola, though they are atop much taller towers. </p>
