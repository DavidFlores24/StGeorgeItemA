            <h3>1780 The Birth of Robert Smirke</h3>
            <h4>‘He was a first-class builder architect…’ James Ferguson, 1849</h4>
            <p>St George’s was designed by the architect Sir Robert Smirke. Born in 1780, the son of artist Robert Smirke Senior, he went on to study under Sir John Soane before enrolling at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1796. That same year he won the Academy’s prestigious Silver Medal, and rose through the ranks of young artisans to become one of the three ‘Crown Architects’ at London’s Office of Works, alongside Soane and the great John Nash. Together they were responsible for the design of some of the capital’s great public buildings. One of Smirke’s early triumphs was the Theatre Royal Covent Garden (1809), long since destroyed by fire, then in 1823 the impressive British Museum and, in 1829, the General Post Office (demolished in 1912). Beyond large public buildings, Smirke became something of a go-to man for club houses and provincial residences, not to mention someone who could reliably fix other people’s problem builds, such as Millbank Prison which he completed in 1821. <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Mr Smirke is pre-eminent in construction, in this respect he has not his superior in the United Kingdom,’  The Athenian, 1828 <br/>
              <br/>
              A champion of the ‘Greek Revival’ style, whcih the young architect studied on a Grand Tour of Europe in the early 1800s, Smirke employed the aesthetics of the great temples in many of his designs, favouring their simple grandeur and restraint of design. This can be seen  in the  surviving façade of the British Museum and a handful of churches still standing around the country - including St George’s. <br/>
              <br/>
              Smirke was also a pioneer, developing new methods of construction, including the use of measured concrete mixes for foundations and iron beams for bearing heavy loads, such as those used in the galleries here at St George’s. A busy man, Smirke is said to have often had more work can he could handle, working with a team of assistant apprentices; it is also said the quality of his work eventually suffered from over-production. In the end, he was too much of a professional to be an artist, too busy to be very original. <br/>
              <br/>
              Knighted in 1832, Sir Robert was awarded the RIBA Gold Medal for Architecture in 1853, just a few years before his official retirement and a final move from London to Cheltenham, where he died in 1867. </p>

            <h3>1818</h3>
            <h4>A new wave of church building</h4>
            <p>St George’s, as a building, exists thanks to an act of Parliament which was passed in 1818. It recognised that there was a lack of church accommodation in towns that had grown exponentially; in other words, lots of people and not enough seats. A large proportion of seats in churches were paid for by the occupants, the wealthier parishioners, and so the poor and penniless had to fight over whatever free seats remained. The revolution in France was still a very recent memory, and the Church saw itself as the first line of defence in keeping the public in line. The rise of non-conformist churches, such as those devoted to Methodism, was a further threat as their newly built chapels were offering sanctuary to an otherwise church-less class. <br/>
              <br/>
              The passing of the Act led to the establishment of the Commission for the Building of New Churches, a board of some 34 men (some clergymen, some not) which sought applications from Parishes across the country. They made £1m available, with a maximum of £20,000 available for successful applicants. The board sought to provide proper accommodation for the poor at the least expense of course, so it sought the advice of the Crown Architects in the capital, asking for estimates for likely churches and best practice in terms of design. Sir John Soane, John Nash, and Robert Smirke, each provided specimen drawings for potential church designs, with Soane’s own basic outline for what he considered the best general specification being adopted by each architect in their own designs. <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘The interior of churches, to be within the compass of an ordinary voice, should not exceed in length about 90 feet, and in breadth 70; that the square and parallelogram are the most economical forms… That the gallery in small churches be sustained by iron pillars… The ceilings should be flat. The windows should be principally of iron, glazed in small squares in metal. The pews and finishings should be generally of deal, and with the stuccoing painted.’ <br/>
              <br/>
              Of the original churches built following the Act, 3 were designed by Soane, 2 by Nash and 7 by Smirke. It was so successful an operation that a second Act was passed in 1824 and a further grant made available; in total 600 new churches were built, and though there is a mixture of architectural styles, the prevailing view of the Commission seems to have been Gothic for those built in the country, Classical for town churches. Each of Smirke’s designs were in the Classical style, save for one single Gothic design (St George’s, Tyldesley). </p>

            <h3>1821</h3>
            <h4>Building St George</h4>
            <p>By 1821 the Commission for the Building of New Churches was having difficulty forming an opinion of all the plans for new churches and chapels being submitted to them, and sought the help of architects from the Office of Works - including Robert Smirke. So, although the Parish in Bristol had asked for a design for its new chapel from Smirke, they actually selected an alternate design submitted by another architect, Henry Hake Seward, and sent it to London. This was in fact one of a pair of designs by Seward for the new chapel, the first being in the Gothic style, the second in the Grecian style. It was Seward’s Grecian design the Parish chose. When the Commission learned that Smirke had drawn a plan for the Bristol chapel that not been submitted, they demanded to see it. Seemingly striking a deal with their own man, the Commissioners went ahead with Smirke’s plan and overruled the Parish. <br/>
              <br/>
              In September 1821 an advert was placed in the Bristol and Gloucester papers inviting tenders for the building of the new chapel. Tradesmen were to contact Mr Thomas Brigden, hired by Smirke as Clerk of the Works to manage the project. Work began on the site, which had been bought in 1820 by the Parish as a burial ground, though the hillside location meant deeper foundations than usual were needed, and the excavations revealed signs of an old quarry on the site. It wouldn’t be an easy build, but the first stone was laid on 27 November 1821. Smirke chose to use rubble stone for the building, faced with striking Bath stone, in-keeping with the few houses and terraces that had already been built nearby. Stone for the aisle floors was sourced from the Forest of Dean, and all of the interior woodwork was carved of Deal, an inexpensive soft wood. <br/>
              <br/>
              By July 1822 the walls had been built up to the gallery floor, and the roof framed together and ready for fixing; then by July 1823 the building was near completion, except for painting.
              
              The full cost of the building was covered by the Commission (£9,263), though the Parish had already raised considerable funds towards the project, expecting the Commission to pay only part. The money raised locally instead went on the interior fixtures, fittings and furnishings. </p>

            <h3>1840's & 1870's</h3>
            <h4>Creating a more church-like character</h4>
            <p>The chapel was originally designed for capacity above all else, the more seats the better to give people access to worship. That came at the expense of the interior design, however, which was spare to say the least; a plain and simple layout, muted colours and lots of wood. The pulpit, also made of wood, was of the three-decker type and likely quite imposing. <br/>
              <br/>
              Access was also an issue and in 1845 changes were approved which saw the creation of two external doors and stairways at the West end of the church; this eased congestion at the main West Door, allowing those sitting in the galleries their own entrances. <br/>
              <br/>
              By 1871 there was a move to give St George’s a more ‘church-like character’, and various options were considered – including an alarming one that sought to create an ‘apse’ (or curved recess) behind the altar, by knocking through the tower wall. This was rightly deemed too unsafe, and so another plan was devised. Local architects Foster & Wood (under the guidance of Bristol’s own eminent architect G.E. Street) were commissioned to create an opulent ‘Chancel’ (including a new pulpit, reading desk and choir stalls) made of white Sicilian marble. Based on Chancels of the Italian Basilica churches, specifically that found in the Church of San Clemente in Rome, it made for an impressive addition to St George’s when it was completed in 1872. <br/>
              <br/>
              The following year plans were drawn up to ‘reseat’ the church, replacing the high box pews and removing a whole section of the West (Central) Gallery, which was once twice the depth that it is today. To accommodate the loss of seats in the gallery, the pipe organ was relocated to the North (Side) Gallery </p>

            <h3>1980's</h3>
            <h4>The Beginning of a Concert Hall</h4>
            <p>As far as the interior of the church is concerned it changed very little after the Victorian refurbishment, save for the addition of electric light in 1927, and a major redecoration scheme in 1972 which returned it to its original 1823 colour scheme. From the end of 1976 the church was shared by the fledgling St George’s Music Trust and minor alterations began to take place in order to accommodate musicians and technicians. One of the earliest changes in this period is the removal of the choir stalls from the chancel, so that musicians could arrange themselves more comfortably on the marble platform. Then, following the official closure of the church in April 1984, but before the Music Trust signed a lease for the building late in 1985, the BBC was granted permission to construct a permanent studio room above the porch at the West end of the building. Work began in March 1985, just ahead of the bells being removed from the belfry, and it was the first of a number of additions the corporation would pay for, including internal double glazing and stage curtains. <br/>
              <br/>
              The first major fundraising for refurbishment began in the Spring/Summer of 1985, with a view to raising half a million pounds to undertake vital works. It was to be the first in a run of major redevelopment projects over the next 13 years that would see the Trust’s vision for St George’s become a reality. The Summer of 1986 saw work begin on creating better public and artist facilities in part of the crypt, and the creation of a stage in the church capable of holding an ensemble of up to 40 musicians. Foster & Wood’s white marble Chancel was dismantled, numbered, and stored beneath the new platform, which was sponsored by Bristol & West. <br/>
              <br/>
              All of these works were designed by Ferguson Mann Architects, who created a number of plans for the venue that ultimately wouldn’t see the light of day at this time. It would be some years before the crypt would be a fully functioning public cafe/bar, for example, and public access to the hall would continue to be from the back doors until the next round of works was completed in the early 1990s. Some of the never-realised plans include the creation of a lobby at the back of the hall, with a glass partition. There were also plans for car parking spaces to be created amongst the trees off of the current car park! </p>

            <h3>1991 - 1995</h3>
            <h4>A venue fit for purpose</h4>
            <p>The first round of redevelopment works in 1986/7 achieved a huge amount, but it was the next round of works which began in 1991 that would bring St George’s Brandon Hill (as it was now known) up to date and fit for purpose as a public concert hall. One of the biggest tasks was the clearing of the remaining unused vaults of the crypt, which were off limits but offered huge potential as a public space. <br/>
              <br/>
              Once cleared and excavated to allow more headroom, audience access to the hall would finally be possible from the crypt with the addition of a single staircase and customer lift in each corner. The warren of vaults found perfect uses, from storage and cloakroom facilities, to a private reception space (the Doric Room), a dedicated recording room , and - of course - a fully functioning cafe bar (called the ‘Brandon Buttery’ for a time). These spaces allowed for pre-concert dining, private receptions, exhibitions and, with the addition of internal and external lifts, much-needed access for disabled visitors. In 1995 a box office counter was finally installed in the crypt, the venue’s first. <br/>
              <br/>
              In the hall itself, the biggest change was the creation of a pair of internal staircases that finally created access from the galleries to the stalls level without having to use the external entrances. </p>

            <h3>1998 - 1999</h3>
            <h4>Sorting the seating</h4>
            <p>By the end of the 1990s St George’s Brandon Hill was nationally renowned as a concert hall, but the seating arrangements in the hall were becoming less than ideal. Uncomfortable wooden pews still served as the stalls seating, while the original bench seats in the galleries posed problems for sight lines and were equally uncomfortable. Also with the venue having gone from strength to strength, there was potential to increase the number of seats available.  The removal of the pipe organ in 1986, and further gallery seats, to create fire escape routes, had only depleted available seating; something had to be done. <br/>
              <br/>
              Major capital development applications were submitted to Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund in 1997, with a view to see to these myriad seating issues, not to mention further improvements to the backstage facilities, heating, and the creation of a public box office for the first time.  The application was successful and work began in 1998 with a view to relaunch the venue in the Spring of 1999; there was a lot to do in a short space of time. <br/>
              <br/>
              Pews were removed, some sold or given away (Tobacco Factory Theatres made use of a number of them), some reconditioned for use in the crypt; they were replaced by brand new concert hall chairs made by Luke Hughes in London. Up in the gallery the bench seats were all removed while the gradient of the seating was amended to increase the height of the rows. The existing benches were revised for comfort, the backs sloped and the seats widened before being re-fitted into the galleries, with padding added for comfort.<br/>
              <br/>
              Other improvements included work to the roof and exterior, additional stage lighting and blackout blinds, an eventual move of the box office within the crypt (complete with a computerised ticketing system), the purchase of a new piano, the relocation of the war memorial, and the commissioning of artwork for the grounds. </p>

            <h3>2017 - 2018</h3>
            <h4>A bold new vision</h4>
            <p>By 2012, with the building approaching its 190th Birthday, it was becoming clear that St George’s needed to assess its future. Each of the building’s major redevelopments had been carried out in response to a need, even the earliest amendments to the building in 1845. 167 years on, and the requirements and vision of the organisation, not to the mention the needs of audiences and artists, would inspire the boldest redevelopment plan yet realised on this site. <br/>
              <br/>
              St George’s was feeling pot-bound, indeed every space within the confines of Robert Smirke’s original four walls that could logically be used had been. Not enough desk space, not enough breakout space for large ensembles or choirs, limited facilities for visiting groups or education activities, plus a bar and toilets so cramped that audiences were becoming accustomed to queuing for both. <br/>
              <br/>
              The answer was to be an extension, a broadening of the footprint of the building so that St George’s could not only deliver what it does best even better, but grow further still. There was no question that whatever was designed should not take away from the stunning Grade II* listed building that has stood here since 1823, and we knew that it was possible to add to it tastefully. Architects Patel Taylor came up with a design that did just that, taking advantage of the terraced site by slotting their new building into the hillside. A pavilion of glass, metal and stone, with a living roof, proved popular. It would provide us with the necessary space to move our existing public bar facilities out of the crypt, allowing us to create more public toilets, office space and somewhere to tell our story. The backstage facilities would be enlarged by moving the box office and disabled toilet out into another part of the crypt. Upstairs in the new building, one large room could become two smaller ones, catering for meetings, parties, events, and even breakout space for larger performing groups.<br/>
              <br/>
              It might be the realisation of a vision that began in 2012, but it’s also just the latest chapter in an architectural story almost 200 years in the making. </p>
